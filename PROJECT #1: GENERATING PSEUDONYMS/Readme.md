<h1><strong>PROJECT #1: GENERATING PSEUDONYMS</strong></h1>

<h2>The Objective</h2>

<p>Randomly generate funny sidekick names using Python code that conforms
to established style guidelines.</p>

<h3>There are two types of software development plans</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Prototype and Patch</li>
    <li>Designed Development</li>
</ul>


<h2>The Strategy</h2>
<p>we’ll start with two lists—first and last—of funny names. The lists will be relatively short, so they won’t be memory intensive, won’t need to be dynamically updated, and shouldn’t present any runtime issues. Since all you’ll need to do is read names from the list, you’ll use a tuple as a container.</p>

<p>we should also highlight the name in the interpreter window somehow so it stands out from the command prompts.</p>

<h2>The Pseudocode</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Load a list of first names</li>
    <li>Load a list of surnames</li>
    <li>Choose a first name at random</li>
    <li>Assign the name to a variable</li>
    <li>Choose a surname at random</li>
    <li>Assign the name to a variable</li>
    <li>Print the names to the screen in order and in red font</li>
    <li>Ask the user to quit or play again</li>
    <li>If user plays again</li>
    <ul>
        <li>repeat</li>
    </ul>
    <li>If user quits</li>
    <ul>
        <li>end and quit</li>
    </ul>
   
</ul>
